# CodeFellows 301 - 12/8 Lecture Notes
* When running a new server for the first ime (a cloned one) run "npm install"
* If dotenv is required, create a .env and write the port #
## Express 
* builds the entire server - it creates all protocols for listening and talking over http
## Cors
* "firewall"

## Shred Talk: 1:24 - repl.it

## Promise - 1:35
* Javascript runs mostly synchronously
* parts of JS run in the background for tasks that take a long time; asynchronous
* JavaScript wrapped all long tasks into 'Promise'
* A promise is something that is is promising to give the app data later
* Promises declare functionality, similar to listeners or route handlers
* WHEN the promise comes back THEN run some code

## Error handling: 1hr 48min

## Superagent 2:13
```javascript
const superagent = require('superagent');
```
```javascript
const gpsData = superagent.get(`https://usl.locationiq.com/v1/search.php?key=${GEOCODE API KEY}&q=las vegas&format=json&limit=1`)
```
## Location API Data: 2:48
* Successful location data through superagent will always be in "body" ie: (whatComesBack.body)
* GEOCADE API KEY="thekey" added to .env
* Reference the API key from the .env in server.js:
```javascript
const GEOCODE_API_KEY
```
### Pulling location data correctly: 3:00



# Read: 07a - What Google Learned About Teams

Reflecting again on this great article, I still find it almost comical how simple their findings were. To me, what Google discovered after immense study and research, is that humans work best when they're treated with human dignity. The worst workplace is one where you just feel like a drone, and worse even, that your input and perspectivees are valueless. I also firmly believe that organizations work better the more democratic they are; the more input and power the entire workforce of a company has, the more effective it will be. I'm glad that Google was able to come to a similar conclusion, and I hope other companies accross the globe take into serious consideration.

* HTTP was a huge breakthrough, it can describe anything in the world, from anywhere in the world!
* Polymorphism: "a geeky way of saying that different nouns can have the same verb applied to them." - Ryan Tomayko
* "HTTP is actually a general purpose protocol for applying verbs to nouns."  - Ryan Tomayko
