# Reading 36 - Redux

## Dan Abramov Redux Tutorials
## Pure/Impure Functions
- Pure functions - no outside effects, predictable, do not alter the arguments passed to them
- Impure Functions - may call APIs, may write to DOM, may overrite values passed to them

## Reducer Function
- State mutations must be pure functions that:
  - Take the previous state
  - The action
  - Returns the next state

  - Does not modify the values
  - One pure function for all the state changes of an entire app

## The Redux Flow
- Central Store in each Application
- 3rd Party Library - Stores entire application state
- Redux is about having a clear;y defined process of how your state may change 
- Flow
  - Actions - Dispatched from components
  - State changes will be "reduced" to a single, pure function
  - Subscription model is made subscribing to the central store

## Dispatching Actions
- ```store.dispatch({type: 'INC_COUNTER'});```
- ```store.dispatch({type: 'ADD_COUNTER'});```
- Any other properties can be added:
- ```store.dispatch({type: 'INC_COUNTER', payload, value: 10, etc});```

## Subscriptions
- No need to call getState
```javascript
store.subscribe(() => {
  console.log(store.getstate());
})
```
## Connecting React to Redux
- Create/import store in index.js
- import { createStore } from 'redux';
- npm install react-redux
- import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
- import { Connect } from 'react-redux';
  - a function that returns a Higher Order Component

- How we configure the state:
```javascript
const mapStateToProps = state => {
  return {
    ctr: state.counter
  }
}

export default connect(mapStateToProps)(Counter);
```

## Dispatching Actions from Compenent
- Note: if your dispatch action doesn't need a slice of state, just dispatch null (as first arguemtn in export defualt connect)
```javascript
const mapDispatchToProps = dispatch => {
  return {
    onIncrementCounter: () => dispatch({type: 'INCREMENT'})
  };
};

export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(Counter);
```

# Switch instead of If statements in the Reducer

## Updating State Immutably
- New state must be made as a copied object with all the new/updated properties (and including the old properties)
- Use Object.assign or spread
  - ...state 
- Use .concat()
  - [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/concat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/concat)


## Updating Arrays Immutably
- Possible to make a copy of the array
  - But, objects within an array are still "pointing" to their original object locations
- Better approach .filter() for DELETING
  - ```const updatedArray = state.results.filter((result, index => index !== id);```
    - Filtering through the array and only returning the results that don't have the ID we want to delete
### See 265 for Immutable Update Patterns




## Review, Research, and Discussion
1. What are the advantages of storing tokens in “Cookies” vs “Local Storage”
  - Cookies are sent by default all HTTP requests to your server, and can be secured more easily.
2. Explain 3rd party cookies.
  - Cookies that are created by a party other than the current website being visited, usually used for tracking purposes.
3. How do pixel tags work?
  - A single pixel image that links to an external server for tracking purposes.

## Terms
- cookies
  - Small pieces of data that get stored locally by a website or web app, used for storing stateful data
- authorization
  - Providing access to specific resources
- access control  
  - The management of who can access what resources and how, usually broken into roles
- conditional rendering
  - Rendering different components depending on different conditions

# Reading 37

## Review, Research, and Discussion

In your reading notes page for this class, provide answers to the following prompts. Cite any external sources

1. Why choose Redux instead of the Context API for global state?
  - Much better for a large app
1. What is the purpose of a reducer?
  - To store and update the state in a single location
1. What does an action contain?
  - A type an payload, where type is the action type and payload any additional data
1. Why do we need to copy the state in a reducer?
  - We don't ever want to mutate the original state, only make identical copies with the old state + changes

### Document the following Vocabulary Terms

Term                            
- immutable state
  - States that cannot be modified 
- time travel in redux
  - A debugging tool for recording the action and state of redux at any given time
- action creator
  - A separate file for creating actions that can be imported
- reducer
  - A function that specifically stores and makes changes to the state for an entire application, returning changed state
- dispatch
  - The method of using an action to update the state


<br/><br/><br/><br/>






# Reading 38: Redux - Asynchronous Actions

## Review, Research, and Discussion

In your reading notes page for this class, provide answers to the following prompts. Cite any external sources

1. How granular should your reducers be?
  - It is best to have as many reducers as there are 'concerns' in an app, since accessing deeply-nested state can be difficult
1. Pro or Con -- multiple reducers can "fire" when a commonly named action is dispatched
  - Con, this will easily effect more of the state than is needed.
1. Name a strategy for preventing the above
  -Its best to have small reducer functions with specific responsibilities & small slices of state concerned, that way it doesn't effect the state beyond its concern.

### Document the following Vocabulary Terms

- store
  - the location for the reducers, typically a folder just called "store"
- combined reducers
  - A method of separating out concerns of reducers into multiple files, then combining them to be accessible through a single reducer route and import


<br/><br/><br/><br/>




# Reading 39: Redux - Additional Topics

## Review, Research, and Discussion


1. What's the best practice for "pre-loading" data into the store (on application start) in a Redux application?
  - Having an initial state object
1. When using a thunk/async action that dispatches the actual action, which do you export from your reducer?
  - The action itself

### Document the following Vocabulary Terms


- middleware - any code that runs between two other actions
- thunk - Code that does delayed work

# Reading 41: React Native

## Review, Research, and Discussion

In your reading notes page for this class, provide answers to the following prompts. Cite any external sources

1. Compare and Contrast Redux Toolkit with Redux "Ducks"
1. What is the principle advantage of Redux Toolkit

### Document the following Vocabulary Terms

| Term                            |
| ------------------------------- |
| redux toolkit slices            |
| namespace                       |
