# Reading 36 - Redux

## Dan Abramov Redux Tutorials
## Pure/Impure Functions
- Pure functions - no outside effects, predictable, do not alter the arguments passed to them
- Impure Functions - may call APIs, may write to DOM, may overrite values passed to them

## Reducer Function
- State mutations must be pure functions that:
  - Take the previous state
  - The action
  - Returns the next state

  - Does not modify the values
  - One pure function for all the state changes of an entire app

## The Redux Flow
- Central Store in each Application
- 3rd Party Library - Stores entire application state
- Redux is about having a clear;y defined process of how your state may change 
- Flow
  - Actions - Dispatched from components
  - State changes will be "reduced" to a single, pure function
  - Subscription model is made subscribing to the central store

## Dispatching Actions
- ```store.dispatch({type: 'INC_COUNTER'});```
- ```store.dispatch({type: 'ADD_COUNTER'});```
- Any other properties can be added:
- ```store.dispatch({type: 'INC_COUNTER', payload, value: 10, etc});```

## Subscriptions
- No need to call getState
```javascript
store.subscribe(() => {
  console.log(store.getstate());
})
```
## Connecting React to Redux
- Create/import store in index.js
- import { createStore } from 'redux';
- npm install react-redux
- import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
- import { Connect } from 'react-redux';
  - a function that returns a Higher Order Component

- How we configure the state:
```javascript
const mapStateToProps = state => {
  return {
    ctr: state.counter
  }
}

export default connect(mapStateToProps)(Counter);
```

## Dispatching Actions from Compenent
- Note: if your dispatch action doesn't need a slice of state, just dispatch null (as first arguemtn in export defualt connect)
```javascript
const mapDispatchToProps = dispatch => {
  return {
    onIncrementCounter: () => dispatch({type: 'INCREMENT'})
  };
};

export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(Counter);
```

# Switch instead of If statements in the Reducer

## Updating State Immutably
- New state must be made as a copied object with all the new/updated properties (and including the old properties)
- Use Object.assign or spread
  - ...state 
- Use .concat()
  - [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/concat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/concat)


## Updating Arrays Immutably
- Possible to make a copy of the array
  - But, objects within an array are still "pointing" to their original object locations
- Better approach .filter() for DELETING
  - ```const updatedArray = state.results.filter((result, index => index !== id);```
    - Filtering through the array and only returning the results that don't have the ID we want to delete
### See 265 for Immutable Update Patterns




## Review, Research, and Discussion
1. What are the advantages of storing tokens in “Cookies” vs “Local Storage”
  - Cookies are sent by default all HTTP requests to your server, and can be secured more easily.
2. Explain 3rd party cookies.
  - Cookies that are created by a party other than the current website being visited, usually used for tracking purposes.
3. How do pixel tags work?
  - A single pixel image that links to an external server for tracking purposes.

## Terms
- cookies
  - Small pieces of data that get stored locally by a website or web app, used for storing stateful data
- authorization
  - Providing access to specific resources
- access control  
  - The management of who can access what resources and how, usually broken into roles
- conditional rendering
  - Rendering different components depending on different conditions
