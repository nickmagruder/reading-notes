# Lecture Notes

## forEach
* forEach is a method called on arrays taht takes in a acallback functions
* it calls the callback function on each element in the array

## callbackFunction
* calbackFuncton is function we create that gets passed into forEach and can do whatever we want it to
* It will always receive these three things in order:
* - the index we are currently on
* - the index of that element
* - the array we are operating on itself

Magic property for automatic margin/padding

## Getting Started
#### Jquery Sololearn Demo: https://www.sololearn.com/Play/jQuery

"It is a good practice to wait for the HTML document to be fully loaded and ready before working with it.
For that we use the ready event of the document object:"
```javascript
$(document).ready(function() {
   // jQuery code goes here
});
``` 

```
"The $ is used to access jQuery. From here, the code accesses the document object and defines a function to be called when the document's ready event is fired.
This prevents any jQuery code from running before the document is finished loading.
Since the code above is used in almost all cases when using jQuery, there is a handy shortcut for writing it:"
```

```javascript
$(function() {
   // jQuery code goes here
});
```

"This code performs the same task as the longer code above."

## Syntax
#### Jquery Sololearn Demo: https://www.sololearn.com/Play/jQuery
```
"jQuery is used to select (query) HTML elements and perform "actions" on them.
Basic syntax is: $("selector").action()
- The $ accesses jQuery.
- The (selector) finds HTML elements.
- The action() is then performed on the element(s)."

For example:
```

```javascript
$("p").hide()  // hides all <p> elements
$(".demo").hide()  // hides all elements with class="demo"
$("#demo").hide()  // hides the element with id="demo"
```
"Looking back at the code from our previous example:"
```javascript
$("#start").html("Go!");
```

```
"This selects the element with the id="start" and calls the html() method for it. The html() method is used to change the HTML content of an element."
```

## Selectors 
#### Jquery Sololearn Demo: https://www.sololearn.com/Play/jQuery

```javascript
$("div.menu")  // all <div> elements with class="menu"

$("p:first")  // the first <p> element

$("h1, p") // all <h1> and all <p> elements

$("div p") // all <p> elements that are descendants of a <div> element

$("*")  // all elements of the DOM
```

## Attributes
#### Jquery Sololearn Demo: https://www.sololearn.com/Play/jQuery
```
"The attr() method also allows us to set a value for an attribute by specifying it as the second parameter.
For example:"
```
```javascript
$(function() {
  $("a").attr("href", "http://www.jquery.com");
});
```
## Removing Attributes
#### Jquery Sololearn Demo: https://www.sololearn.com/Play/jQuery
```
"You can also remove attributes from HTML elements.
The removeAttr() method is used for removing any attribute of an element. In the example below we remove the border and class attributes of the table:"
```

```javascript
$("table").removeAttr("border");
$("table").removeAttr("class"); 
```

## Relative Viewport Lengths

* vw - Viewports width
* vh - Viewports height
* vmin - Minimum of the viewport’s height and width
* vmax - Maximum of the viewport’s height and width

* target ÷ context = result

## Flexible Grid
Taking the flexible layout concept, and formula, and reapplying it to all parts of a grid will create a completely dynamic website, scaling to every viewport size. For even more control within a flexible layout, you can also leverage the min-width, max-width, min-height, and max-height properties.

### Media Queries
Media queries were built as an extension to media types commonly found when targeting and including styles. Media queries provide the ability to specify different styles for individual browser and device circumstances, the width of the viewport or device orientation for example. Being able to apply uniquely targeted styles opens up a world of opportunity and leverage to responsive web design.

## Initializing Media Queries
It is recommend to use the @media rule inside of an existing style sheet to avoid any additional HTTP requests.

## Logical Operators in Media Queries
### and
Using the and logical operator within a media query allows an extra condition to be added, making sure that a browser or devices does both a, b, c, and so forth
### not
The not logical operator negates the query, specifying any query but the one identified.
### only
The only logical operator is a new operator and is not recognized by user agents using the HTML4 algorithm, Below, the expression selects only screens in a portrait orientation that have a user agent capable of rending media queries.
```css
@media only screen and (orientation: portrait) {...}
```

### Omitting a Media Type
When using the not and only logical operators the media type may be left off. In this case the media type is defaulted to all.
