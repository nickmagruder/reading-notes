## Getting Started
#### Jquery Sololearn Demo: https://www.sololearn.com/Play/jQuery

"It is a good practice to wait for the HTML document to be fully loaded and ready before working with it.
For that we use the ready event of the document object:"
```javascript
$(document).ready(function() {
   // jQuery code goes here
});
``` 

```
"The $ is used to access jQuery. From here, the code accesses the document object and defines a function to be called when the document's ready event is fired.
This prevents any jQuery code from running before the document is finished loading.
Since the code above is used in almost all cases when using jQuery, there is a handy shortcut for writing it:"
```

```javascript
$(function() {
   // jQuery code goes here
});
```

"This code performs the same task as the longer code above."

## Syntax
#### Jquery Sololearn Demo: https://www.sololearn.com/Play/jQuery
```
"jQuery is used to select (query) HTML elements and perform "actions" on them.
Basic syntax is: $("selector").action()
- The $ accesses jQuery.
- The (selector) finds HTML elements.
- The action() is then performed on the element(s)."

For example:
```

```javascript
$("p").hide()  // hides all <p> elements
$(".demo").hide()  // hides all elements with class="demo"
$("#demo").hide()  // hides the element with id="demo"
```
"Looking back at the code from our previous example:"
```javascript
$("#start").html("Go!");
```

```
"This selects the element with the id="start" and calls the html() method for it. The html() method is used to change the HTML content of an element."
```

## Selectors 
#### Jquery Sololearn Demo: https://www.sololearn.com/Play/jQuery

```javascript
$("div.menu")  // all <div> elements with class="menu"

$("p:first")  // the first <p> element

$("h1, p") // all <h1> and all <p> elements

$("div p") // all <p> elements that are descendants of a <div> element

$("*")  // all elements of the DOM
```

## Attributes
#### Jquery Sololearn Demo: https://www.sololearn.com/Play/jQuery
```
"The attr() method also allows us to set a value for an attribute by specifying it as the second parameter.
For example:"
```
```javascript
$(function() {
  $("a").attr("href", "http://www.jquery.com");
});
```
## Removing Attributes
#### Jquery Sololearn Demo: https://www.sololearn.com/Play/jQuery
```
"You can also remove attributes from HTML elements.
The removeAttr() method is used for removing any attribute of an element. In the example below we remove the border and class attributes of the table:"
```

```javascript
$("table").removeAttr("border");
$("table").removeAttr("class"); 
```
