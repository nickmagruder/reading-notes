# Reading 01

- Describe (in plain English) what Array.map() does
    - array.map() "maps" over each object in an array and runs the written code on each object. When done, it puts the results in a new array the same length as the one mapped.

- Describe (in plain English) what Array.reduce() does
    - array.reduce() also iterates over each object in an array, but it can change the shape of the array objects, or it can "accumulate" all of the array objects and return something like a sum of them.

## Provide code snippets showing how to use superagent() to fetch data from a URL and log the result
* With normal Promise .then() syntax


```javascript
async function getCity(city) {
  let results = await superagent.get(`https://geocode.xyz/${city}?json=1`);
  console.log(results.body.latt, results.body.longt);
}

getCity('Dallas');
```


* Again with async / await syntax


```javascript
function getCity(city) {
superagent.get(`https://geocode.xyz/${city}?json=1`)
  .then( data => {
        console.log(data.body.latt, data.body.longt);
  })
}

getCity('Dallas');
```

- Explain promises as though you were mentoring a Code 301 level student
    - A promise is a method for having different functions run out-of-order, particularly when a task will take a while to complete, and you don't want to stop your other code from continuing to run. When the code is done, the data is returned to be used in the rest of your code. Like other callbacks they either fail or succeed, and their syntax need success & error.

- Are all callback functions considered to be Asynchronous? Why or Why Not?
    - No, because some callbacks can be run in-order, and don't necessarily always send a task off of the stack to be completed.



# Reading 02

## What’s the difference between PUT and PATCH?
* 

## Provide links to 3 services or tools that allow you to “mock” an API for development like json-server
[]()
[]()
[]()

## Compare and contrast Swagger and APIDoc.js. Which HTTP status codes should be sent with each type of (un)successful API call?

## Compare and contrast SOAP and ReST

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms
* Web Server - an application that receive and process client HTTP requests
* Express - A Library/Framework for creating servers (and its routes), Staddles the line of being fully a "framework" but is also a library, unopinionated
* Routing - The HTTP paths used by express to send and receive data and requests between the front and backends.
* WRRC - Web Response/Request cycle


# Reading 03

1. Name 3 real world use cases where you’d want to change the request with custom middleware
* 

2. True or false: The route handler is middleware?
* True - https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html

3. In what ways can a middleware function end the process and send data to the browser?

4. At what point in the request lifecycle can you “inject” middleware?

5. What can cause express to error with “Request headers sent twice, cannot start a second response”




# Lecture Notes

# 2/16 Lecture
## Whiteboarding & code challenges, CI/CD, Node Modules, Express at High Level, Routing/Middleware

# Express
## Library/Framework
- Staddles the line of being fully a "framework" but is also a library
- Ability to take in HTTP request to EXPRESS then return an HTTP response
- It can define routes
- Unopinionated - "Plug functions in, they might not work at cause errors"

- Jest: test runner
- SuperTest - mimics HTTP requests/responses

- Building basic server tests - 10:10

## Middleware
* any function sitting inside an express route
* should always finish with the "next" function 
* "next" = "im done, move on"
* Req/Res not mandatory in a route, req/res can be within the callback function

## Error Handling Middleware - 10:42
- if error message = x , do this

## UML - Universal Modeling Language
- "This is all the data my applicaiton needs, and this is how it fits together"

- Tests can't complete? 11:48

- Empty objects in JS are "truthy"

# How to solve Programming Problems

* Biggest mistake: bad time allocation
* Don't drive straight into writing code, don't overthink it


```
A simple set of steps
I am going to give you a simple set of steps to follow which you can use for any algorithm type programming problem.
Read the problem completely twice.

1. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
2. Optimize the manual steps.
3. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
4. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
5. Optimize the real code.
6. As much as 70% of our time should be spent in steps 1-3.
```
[https://simpleprogrammer.com/solving-problems-breaking-it-down/](https://simpleprogrammer.com/solving-problems-breaking-it-down/)

* Never forgot that all code is essentially automation, always solve the problem manually first!
* Use mathematical induction
* Look for corner caser and edge cases
* After manual solution, optimize and write pseudo-code comment solution
* Convert each comment into a line of real code

## Know these things in any programming language you use:
```
- Create a list
- Sort a list or array
- Create a map or dictionary
- Loop through a list, or dictionary
- Parse strings
- Convert from string to int, int to string, etc
```

* " “Busyness” Isn’t a Badge of Honor; It’s a Sign of Weakness "
* "Busyness and stress are the enemy"
* FOcus deeply and don't waste time
* Do not tolerate distractions
* Make sure all your time is dedicated to truly valuable tasks


# How to think like a programmer — lessons in problem solving

* “Everyone in this country should learn to program a computer, because it teaches you to think.” — Steve Jobs
* Find the MOST effective way to problem solve!

# Create a framework and Practice it!

* Common mistake: focusing on syntax instead of problem solving

## Problem solving steps:
### 1. Understand
* Be able to explain in basic language
### 2. Plan
* "To get a good plan, answer this question: “Given input X, what are the steps necessary to return output Y?""
### 3. Divide
* Break into smaller, solveable problems.
### 4. Stuck?
* Be curious, not frustrated!
* When researching, only look for solutions to the small problems

# Class 1 2/15

## NodeJS
* Node is a runtime for javascript, for running JS outside of a browser

## Node JS Syntax
* Node module - resources that are "npm installed" to create functionality
* Any javascript code that is able to use node syntax (essentially the same as normal JS, with caveats)

## Module.exports
* code line that makes something available to other JS files running node.js
* "dependency injection"

## require statement
* grabs the node module's "module.exports"

## Creating tests - 11:23am
* Getting the test to work ~11:30
* Lab demo 11:45
* Demo cont'd - adding tests to server ~11:55

# Lab Requirements
## Today's lab: get code, deploy to Heroku!

## Using express as application framework
- What is express?
    - REST - Representational state transfer)
        - Combines method and endpoint to produce consistent API behaviour
        - Get post, put, delete
        - /notes
- HTTP - hypertext transfer procotol
    - We are using HTTP to communicate between front and backends
