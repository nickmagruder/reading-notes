# Read: Class 01

- Describe (in plain English) what Array.map() does
    - array.map() "maps" over each object in an array and runs the written code on each object. When done, it puts the results in a new array the same length as the one mapped.

- Describe (in plain English) what Array.reduce() does
    - array.reduce() also iterates over each object in an array, but it can change the shape of the array objects, or it can "accumulate" all of the array objects and return something like a sum of them.

## Provide code snippets showing how to use superagent() to fetch data from a URL and log the result
* With normal Promise .then() syntax


```javascript
async function getCity(city) {
  let results = await superagent.get(`https://geocode.xyz/${city}?json=1`);
  console.log(results.body.latt, results.body.longt);
}

getCity('Dallas');
```


* Again with async / await syntax


```javascript
function getCity(city) {
superagent.get(`https://geocode.xyz/${city}?json=1`)
  .then( data => {
        console.log(data.body.latt, data.body.longt);
  })
}

getCity('Dallas');
```

- Explain promises as though you were mentoring a Code 301 level student
    - A promise is a method for having different functions run out-of-order, particularly when a task will take a while to complete, and you don't want to stop your other code from continuing to run. When the code is done, the data is returned to be used in the rest of your code. Like other callbacks they either fail or succeed, and their syntax need success & error.

- Are all callback functions considered to be Asynchronous? Why or Why Not?
    - No, because some callbacks can be run in-order, and don't necessarily always send a task off of the stack to be completed.
















# Read: Class 02

## What’s the difference between PUT and PATCH?
- CRUD Updating, to PUT or PATCH?   
- PUT: use for sending data to server to create or change something - indempotent - cannot create multiple redundant resources
    - Only allowed replacement of entire resource, not a single element

- PATCH: used for changing one part of an element at a location, not the entire resource - does not need to be indempodent
    - Failed requets are not automatically re-attempted by the network


## Provide links to 3 services or tools that allow you to “mock” an API for development like json-server
[]()
[]()
[]()

## Compare and contrast Swagger and APIDoc.js. Which HTTP status codes should be sent with each type of (un)successful API call?

## Compare and contrast SOAP and ReST
- SOAP is official web standards maintained by W3C
- REST is not a protocol, but an architectural style, created to address the problems of strictness and complexity of SOAP- More flexible, more lightweight so perform better
    - REST: Representational State Transfer


## Document the following Vocabulary Terms
- Web Server - an application that receive and process client HTTP requests
- Express - A Library/Framework for creating servers (and its routes), Staddles the line of being fully a "framework" but is also a library, unopinionated
- Routing - The HTTP paths used by express to send and receive data and requests between the front and backends.
- WRRC - Web Response/Request cycle













# Read: Class 03

1. Name 3 real world use cases where you’d want to change the request with custom middleware
- To filter out a curse word
- Invalid data (bad or non-unique username, etc)
- Reformatting the data so it works correctly with a database

2. True or false: The route handler is middleware?
- True - https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html

3. In what ways can a middleware function end the process and send data to the browser?
- res.download()
- res.end()
- res.json()
- res.jsonp()
- res.redirect()
- res.render()
- res.send()
- res.sendFile()
- res.sendStatus()

4. At what point in the request lifecycle can you “inject” middleware?
- Anytime between the request and the response

5. What can cause express to error with “Request headers sent twice, cannot start a second response”
- A server is unexpecedly sending multiple  responses to a single request


### Middleware
- Any server code or "app" that acts on a request from a client
### Request Object
- The object sent through with a request from the client
### Response Object
- The object that is created by the server, usually using middleware, and sent back to the client
### Application Middleware
- Middleware that processes code upon the request object
### Routing Middleware
- Middleware that routes the response cycle through the correct code
### Test Driven Development
- Development that is based on testing as a foundation; that the first step for writign code is to first develop a test that will confirm weather the code is accomplishing the task expected.
### Behavioral Testing
- A subset of TDD that employs readable requirements (in normal language) and uses those as the foundation of software testing. This creates shared language between all stateholders. 









# Read: Class 04

### Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development
- Generally higher technical & deisng quality of code
- Decreased effort & problems in a project's late stages
- Significantly lower defect rates

### In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?
- beforeeach/aftereach: if a function needs to be run before/after a test can process

### What is one downside of Test Driven Development
- Uses more time at the beginning to develop the tests

### What’s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?
-  prototypes ARE an object instance, whereas an ES6 is a *type* which can instantiate at runtime 

### Why REST?
- Clients will use the same endpoints, action and receive identical responses from a server

## Vocabulary Terms:
### functional programming
- Definition from Eric Elliott on Medium [https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-functional-programming-7f218c68b3a0](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-functional-programming-7f218c68b3a0)
    - "Functional programming (often abbreviated FP) is the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects. Functional programming is declarative rather than imperative, and application state flows through pure functions. Contrast with object oriented programming, where application state is usually shared and colocated with methods in objects."
        - Functions will always return the same outputs when given the same inputs
        - Code does not have side effects
        - Code does not "share state" with other scopes
        - Code is immutable: it cannot altered after it's creation
### object-oriented programming (OOP)
- JavaScript.
- A paradigm where the foundation of coding is based on "objects" that represent other things and contain data and/or code
### class
* a "special" function, a template for making objects
### super
* a keyword for calling the class constructor
### this
* the current scope ("this" object)
### Test Driven Development
- Development that is based on testing as a foundation; that the first step for writign code is to first develop a test that will confirm weather the code is accomplishing the task expected.
### Jest
- "Jest is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity. It works with projects using: Babel, TypeScript, Node, React, Angular, Vue and more!"
    - From: [https://jestjs.io/](https://jestjs.io/)
### Continuous Integration (CI)
* A methodology of automated processes that continuously integrate new code commits into a project
### REST
* An architectural style that separates the function of the client and server
### Data Model
* Similar to a schema in NoSQL, and synonymous with a schema in SQL datases, it is the structure within which the data will be stored

# Lecture Notes

# Tuesday 2/16 Lecture
## Whiteboarding & code challenges, CI/CD, Node Modules, Express at High Level, Routing/Middleware

# Express
## Library/Framework
- Staddles the line of being fully a "framework" but is also a library
- Ability to take in HTTP request to EXPRESS then return an HTTP response
- It can define routes
- Unopinionated - "Plug functions in, they might not work at cause errors"

- Jest: test runner
- SuperTest - mimics HTTP requests/responses

- Building basic server tests - 10:10

## Middleware
* any function sitting inside an express route
* should always finish with the "next" function 
* "next" = "im done, move on"
* Req/Res not mandatory in a route, req/res can be within the callback function

## Error Handling Middleware - 10:42
- if error message = x , do this

## UML - Universal Modeling Language
- "This is all the data my applicaiton needs, and this is how it fits together"

- Tests can't complete? 11:48

- Empty objects in JS are "truthy"

# How to solve Programming Problems
# John Sonmez
## This section is a reading notes summary based on the article referenced here
[https://simpleprogrammer.com/solving-problems-breaking-it-down/](https://simpleprogrammer.com/solving-problems-breaking-it-down/)

* Biggest mistake: bad time allocation
* Don't drive straight into writing code, don't overthink it


```
A simple set of steps
I am going to give you a simple set of steps to follow which you can use for any algorithm type programming problem.
Read the problem completely twice.

1. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
2. Optimize the manual steps.
3. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
4. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
5. Optimize the real code.
6. As much as 70% of our time should be spent in steps 1-3.
```
[https://simpleprogrammer.com/solving-problems-breaking-it-down/](https://simpleprogrammer.com/solving-problems-breaking-it-down/)

* Never forgot that all code is essentially automation, always solve the problem manually first!
* Use mathematical induction
* Look for corner caser and edge cases
* After manual solution, optimize and write pseudo-code comment solution
* Convert each comment into a line of real code

## Know these things in any programming language you use:
```
- Create a list
- Sort a list or array
- Create a map or dictionary
- Loop through a list, or dictionary
- Parse strings
- Convert from string to int, int to string, etc
```

* " “Busyness” Isn’t a Badge of Honor; It’s a Sign of Weakness "
* "Busyness and stress are the enemy"
* FOcus deeply and don't waste time
* Do not tolerate distractions
* Make sure all your time is dedicated to truly valuable tasks

* “Everyone in this country should learn to program a computer, because it teaches you to think.” — Steve Jobs
* Find the MOST effective way to problem solve!

# Create a framework and Practice it!

* Common mistake: focusing on syntax instead of problem solving

## Problem solving steps:
### 1. Understand
* Be able to explain in basic language
### 2. Plan
* "To get a good plan, answer this question: “Given input X, what are the steps necessary to return output Y?""
### 3. Divide
* Break into smaller, solveable problems.
### 4. Stuck?
* Be curious, not frustrated!
* When researching, only look for solutions to the small problems

## NodeJS
* Node is a runtime for javascript, for running JS outside of a browser

## Node JS Syntax
* Node module - resources that are "npm installed" to create functionality
* Any javascript code that is able to use node syntax (essentially the same as normal JS, with caveats)

## Module.exports
* code line that makes something available to other JS files running node.js
* "dependency injection"

## require statement
* grabs the node module's "module.exports"

## Creating tests - 11:23am
* Getting the test to work ~11:30

## Using express as application framework
- What is express?
    - REST - Representational state transfer)
        - Combines method and endpoint to produce consistent API behaviour
        - Get post, put, delete
        - /notes
- HTTP - hypertext transfer procotol
    - We are using HTTP to communicate between front and backends
