# Design Web Pages with CSS
## Nick's Notes

### Think inside the box!
Every element gets a little box, remember block vs inline elements

selector & declaration, within declaration: property & value

### How rules Cascade:
* If two rules apply, the last one will take precedence
* Also, the more SPECIFIC rule will apply over one that is more general
* Rules will also be "inherited" by children; IE, a rule applied to body will also apply to most elements inside body

# Color
* Color names, 147 options, ie: darkcyan
* Hex code, ie: #000000 or #FFFFFF
* rgb, ie: rgb(100,100,90)

## HSL Colors
Hue, Saturation and **lightness** (not brightness)

## HSLA Colors
* A stands for Alpha, or transparency (expressed as decimal, not percent)
* H for hue, expressed in 0-360 color wheel
* S Saturaion, %
* L Lightness, %

ie: hsl:(0,0%,78%)
ie: hsla(0,100%,100%,.5)
