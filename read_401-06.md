# Code 401 Notes

# Reading 26 - 





## Review, Research, and Discussion
1. Name 5 Javascript UI Frameworks (other than React)
    - Vue.js, Ext JS by Sencha, Angular, Ember, Svelte 3
2. What’s the difference between a framework and a library?
    -There is no hard line, but libraries are typically just a set of code containing functions that can be invoked by referencing the library, where a framework is more complex system with greater interdependencies. Frameworks usually require more installation and configuration to function, and go beyond standard JavaScript code.

    Frameworks have inversion of control. The framework is in charge of the of the flow and tells the developer what is needed to accomplish functions.

## Terms
- Rendering
    -using .render() to create or "render" elements to the page. React elements are immutable.
- Templates
    -Ready-made pieces of code built with React for easily-creating dynamic UX
- State
    - The "state" of a React component class is a set of properties which control how the component behaves. The component's "state" is an object holding information that can change through the lifecycle of a the component.

# Reading 27

## Review, Research, and Discussion
1. Does a deployed React application require a server?
  - Not required, but can integrate with one easily
2. Why do we prefer to test a React application at the behavior rather than the unit level?
  - Because testing how components interact with each other is inherent to the proper function of a React app.
3. What does npm run build do?
  -Creates an optimized build once your app is ready to deploy.
4. Describe the actual composition / architecture of a React application
  - Ideally functions are each split into their own separate component, each accomplishing a specific task.

## Terms
- BDD
  - Behaviour-driven-development
- Acceptance Tests
  -A test that determines whether the requirements of a specification have been met.
- mounting
  - The process by which elements are inserted into the DOM
- build
  - Structuring code so it run properly

# Reading 28

## Review, Research, and Discussion
- Can a parent component access the state of a child component?
  - only if using React.createRef();
- What can be passed along in a prop variable?
  - Any data
- How can a child component “know” the state of another component?
  - It has to be passed through as  a prop

## Terms
- component props
  - Allows components to be more configurable and customizable
  - Properties are immutable; you cannot "update" or add to them.
- component state
  - In React, state is an instance attribute on a component.
  - It’s always an object, since you’ll want to keep track of several keys/values.
- application state
  - Everything that is neded to keep an application functioning, and how those components are passed through the application keepign them accessible to the necessary components


<br/><br/><br/><br/>






# Reading 29

- Do child components have direct access to props/state from the parent?
    - A function can be passed form a parent to child, but the child does not have automatic direct access to the parent's prop and state
- When a component “wraps” another component, how does the child component’s output get rendered?
```javascript
<Main>
  <Content />
</Main>
```
  - It is rendereed within the wrapping parent component, same as with normal HTML.

- Can a component, such as ```<Content />```, which is a child also be used as a standalone component elsewhere in the application?
  - No
- What trick can a parent use to share all props with it’s children
  - Using the spread operator


## Terms
- props.children
  - Used when you want to create a generic "box" that can then be filled with anything (props.children)
- composition
  - How React components are arranged and connected

# Hash Tables
## This section is a set of reading notes based on the following resources:
- [CodeFellows - Hashtables](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-30/resources/Hashtables.html)
- [Paul Programming - What is a HashTable Data Structure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfhjkfocRR0)

- [Udemy js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass by Colt Steel](https://www.udemy.com/course/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass/)


## What makes a good Hash?
- Fast (ie constant time)
- Doesnt cluster outputs at specific indices, but distributes uniformly
- Deterministic, same input yields same ouput

## charcode MINUS 96 = number in the alphabet
- a - 96 = 1

## Use prime numbers, less collisions 

## Handling Collisions
- Separate Chaining
  - Store at same spot using a nested data structure, multiple key-value-pairs a the same position
- Linear probing
  - Only storing one piece of data at each position
  - When collison, we look forward in array to the next empty spot

## Separate Chaining Implementation
- Set / Get
  - Set 
  1. Accept a key and a value
  2. Hash the key
  3. Store the key-value pair in the hash table array via separate chaining
  - Get
  1. Accepts a key
  2. Hashes the key
  3. Retrieves the key-value pair in the hash table
  4. If the key isnt found, returns undefined

### Keys / Values
- Keys
  - Loops through the hash table array and returns an array of keys in the table 
- Values
  - Loops through the hash table array and reutns an array of values in the table

# Lecture Notes

# Monday 3/22
## Lecture Notes
# React - ~10:50
- Yarn VS NPM 11:18
    - "create-tract-app <appname> --use npm" - SEE LECTURE NOTES
- React Demo - 11:20
- "npm install node-sass" for SASS compatibility - 11:22


<br/><br/><br/><br/>





# Tuesday

##  React Project from GitHub - 10:20
- "git remote -v" check if there is a remote repo in the folder
## Props - 10:34
## Tests - 10:47-11:0
## Deployment - 11:56

```
Success! Created resty at /home/iamnotatgregs/codefellows/401/resty/resty
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you can’t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd resty
  npm start
```

# Wednesday 

# Topics for today:
- Component Lifecycle
- View/Layout Logic


- 9:34 - add "aria" roles (classes) to elements in order to run tests on them
- 9:40 - form submission/debugging - done in Jason's form.js
- 10:04 - different React testing query options

- 10:20 - Conditional Rendering - View/Layout Logic
- 10:26 - Toggle Menu
  - Put it within a component
- 10:51 - CSS CALC - ```calc(50% - 200px)```

## Component Lifecycle - 11:10
- What occurs when a component enters the DOM?
  - componentWillMount: setup phase for the component
    - If something must be done before render, do it here
  - componentWillReceiveProps: component received information from its parent
  - render: occurs in "middle" of component's lifecycle
  ### ^ See lecture notes
## Mocking a Server/Testing 11:35
- MSW - Mock Service Worker (npm)
- Gets brought-in to testing suite

- Mocking server/writing tests - 11:39
  - in demo under: pokemon.test.js

## Lab
