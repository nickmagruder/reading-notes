## Review, Research, and Discussion
1. Name 5 Javascript UI Frameworks (other than React)
    - Vue.js, Ext JS by Sencha, Angular, Ember, Svelte 3
2. What’s the difference between a framework and a library?
    -There is no hard line, but libraries are typically just a set of code containing functions that can be invoked by referencing the library, where a framework is more complex system with greater interdependencies. Frameworks usually require more installation and configuration to function, and go beyond standard JavaScript code.

    Frameworks have inversion of control. The framework is in charge of the of the flow and tells the developer what is needed to accomplish functions.

## Terms

    -using .render() to create or "render" elements to the page. React elements are immutable.
- Templates
    -Ready-made pieces of code built with React for easily-creating dynamic UX
- State
    - The "state" of a React component class is a set of properties which control how the component behaves. The component's "state" is an object holding information that can change through the lifecycle of a the component.

Success! Created resty at /home/iamnotatgregs/codefellows/401/resty/resty
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you can’t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd resty
  npm start
```
