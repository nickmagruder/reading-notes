# Code 401 Notes

# Read: Class 06

## Questions

### Explain what a “Singleton” is (in Computer Science terms)
- Restricting a class instantiation to *one single instance*
### Explain how the Singleton pattern can be used with Node modules, specifically with classes
- ...
### If you were tasked with building a middleware system like Express uses, what approach might you take to construct/operate it?
- ...


## Vocabulary

### Router Middleware
- Middleware that routes the response cycle through the correct code

### Dynamic Module Loading
- When a program loads a library/module at runtime into memory, then executes functions using the library, then unloads the library from  memory - [Dynamic Loading- Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_loading#:~:text=Dynamic%20loading%20is%20a%20mechanism,unload%20the%20library%20from%20memory)

### Singleton Pattern
- Restricting a class instantiation to *one single instance*

### CRUD -> REST Method Matches
- Not one-to-one, but roughly equivalent:
- CRUD --- REST/HTTP
- CREATE --- POST/PUT
- READ--- GET
- UPDATE --- PUT/POST/PATCH
- DELETE --- DELETE
    - From [Nordic APIs - Thomas Bush](https://nordicapis.com/crud-vs-rest-whats-the-difference/)
### Mock Testing
- "Mocking is a process used in unit testing when the unit being tested has external dependencies. The purpose of mocking is to isolate and focus on the code being tested and not on the behavior or state of external dependencies. In mocking, the dependencies are replaced by closely controlled replacements objects that simulate the behavior of the real ones. There are three main possible types of replacement objects - fakes, stubs and mocks."
