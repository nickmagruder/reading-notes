# Code 401 Notes

# Read: Class 06

## Questions

### Explain what a “Singleton” is (in Computer Science terms)
- Restricting a class instantiation to *one single instance*
### Explain how the Singleton pattern can be used with Node modules, specifically with classes
- ...
### If you were tasked with building a middleware system like Express uses, what approach might you take to construct/operate it?
- ...


## Vocabulary

### Router Middleware
- Middleware that routes the response cycle through the correct code

### Dynamic Module Loading
- When a program loads a library/module at runtime into memory, then executes functions using the library, then unloads the library from  memory - [Dynamic Loading- Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_loading#:~:text=Dynamic%20loading%20is%20a%20mechanism,unload%20the%20library%20from%20memory)

### Singleton Pattern
- Restricting a class instantiation to *one single instance*

### CRUD -> REST Method Matches
- Not one-to-one, but roughly equivalent:
- CRUD --- REST/HTTP
- CREATE --- POST/PUT
- READ--- GET
- UPDATE --- PUT/POST/PATCH
- DELETE --- DELETE
    - From [Nordic APIs - Thomas Bush](https://nordicapis.com/crud-vs-rest-whats-the-difference/)
### Mock Testing
- "Mocking is a process used in unit testing when the unit being tested has external dependencies. The purpose of mocking is to isolate and focus on the code being tested and not on the behavior or state of external dependencies. In mocking, the dependencies are replaced by closely controlled replacements objects that simulate the behavior of the real ones. There are three main possible types of replacement objects - fakes, stubs and mocks."

# Lecture Notes

# Monday 2/22

# Authentication
- 10:10- - Encoding
- Line 12 on demo - "unary username"
    - Translates for computer
Authheader/authstring - 10:25
- Header says "authorization" but we are not actually performing authorization (line ~19)
- 11:10 - Saving as developer dependencies (not cluttering up the application)

- 11:15-11: - Building a server with auth
    - 11:15 - setup
    - 11:24 - Sign-In Process
    - 11:34 - Testing functionality/deubugging
    - 11:47 - Lab overview

# Tuesday 2/23

# Basic Authentication Code Review

## Rewatch 10:18-10:24

* learn how to use stack traces

## Bearer Tokens 10:40
- data about the user, a header and a signature
    - signature / integrity verification
    - pair the token with a "secret:" a string stored on your server
    -   Payload / data encoded in the token
    -   More secure
    -   JWT: JSON Web Token
    

### Bearer Tokens Demo - 11:11
    - Start of demo build - 11:22
- Rewatch 11:30-11:35

# Wednesday 2/24

# Authorization

# Warmup
## Bracket Notation

# Code Review - Bearer Auth Lab - 9:45

- 10:30-10:45 - Access Control in node server

- 10:45 - Lab Demo Start (Tests first)
    - Install Express, mongoose, base 64, bcrypt, jsonwebtoken, @code-fellows/supergoose, dotenv

- 11:15 - Building user levels schema
    - .virtual "kind of like magic"

- 11:35 - Try/Catches
    - Use whenever doing something error prone
    - Or when handing functionality to something else (third party library, etc)
        - Don't just error out immediately

- Function currying - 11:42
    - Currying: a function that returns another function
        - React uses a lot of functional composition
    - "this is a function that gets a "capability" and it returns "another function"
    - the function is used like a callback
    - invoking functions once to get the capability, thgen again 
    - non-currying (normal functions) do not pass-through capabilities
    
- Activating virtual capability 11:55
    - add this as an additional object after your schema object ```javascript {toJSON: {virtuals: true} }```

## Lab
- Copy V2 tests into V1 (v2 will be harder)
    - V1 - no bearer tokens - can just use a get
- WRRC vs UML - WRRC focuses specifically on the request/response psths
    - UML is more just data-modeling, "what my application achieves"

# Lecture Notes Thursday 2/25

* Rewatch beginning-overview portion

## Lab Project - 10:10
- Minimal complexity
- Basically build a minimal version of swagger to send requests
