# Reading 02

## What’s the difference between PUT and PATCH?
* 

## Provide links to 3 services or tools that allow you to “mock” an API for development like json-server
[]()
[]()
[]()

## Compare and contrast Swagger and APIDoc.js. Which HTTP status codes should be sent with each type of (un)successful API call?

## Compare and contrast SOAP and ReST

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms
* Web Server - an application that receive and process client HTTP requests
* Express - A Library/Framework for creating servers (and its routes), Staddles the line of being fully a "framework" but is also a library, unopinionated
* Routing - The HTTP paths used by express to send and receive data and requests between the front and backends.
* WRRC - Web Response/Request cycle





# 2/16 Lecture
## Whiteboarding & code challenges, CI/CD, Node Modules, Express at High Level, Routing/Middleware

# Express
## Library/Framework
- Staddles the line of being fully a "framework" but is also a library
- Ability to take in HTTP request to EXPRESS then return an HTTP response
- It can define routes
- Unopinionated - "Plug functions in, they might not work at cause errors"

- Jest: test runner
- SuperTest - mimics HTTP requests/responses

- Building basic server tests - 10:10

## Middleware
* any function sitting inside an express route
* should always finish with the "next" function 
* "next" = "im done, move on"
* Req/Res not mandatory in a route, req/res can be within the callback function

## Error Handling Middleware - 10:42
- if error message = x , do this

## UML - Universal Modeling Language
- "This is all the data my applicaiton needs, and this is how it fits together"

- Tests can't complete? 11:48

- Empty objects in JS are "truthy"
