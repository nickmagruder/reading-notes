# Read: 06 - Node, Express, and APIs

# "What Is Node and When Should I Use It?"
## This page is a reading notes summary based on the article referenced here
## By James Hibbard - 2/26/2020
[https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-node-js/](https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-node-js/)

## Node uses Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine
* Open source engine used in Chromium
* Performance-oriented, compiles JS directly to code that can be use by the native computer
* its a "JavaScript runtime" so JS can be executed locally


## Node.js supports modern javascript
* Supports ES6 and later
* Compatability issues of multiple browsers is usually not a problem

## NPM is the Package Manager for JavaScript
* NPM is the largest software registry in the world

## Package.json
* npm saves locad and all libraries to a folder  called node_modules
* Don't check node_modules into version contol

## Node is used for installing and running build tools, for an automated process of JS development
* In order to use frameworks like React or Angular, understand Node & NPM first
* These are available through NPM and are reliant on node

## Node.js is necessary for running JS on a Server

```
"Node.js, however, is single-threaded. Itâ€™s also event-driven, which means that everything that happens in Node is in reaction to an event. For example, when a new request comes in (one kind of event) the server will start processing it. If it then encounters a blocking I/O operation, instead of waiting for this to complete, it will register a callback before continuing to process the next event. When the I/O operation has finished (another kind of event), the server will execute the callback and continue working on the original request. Under the hood, Node uses the libuv library to implement this asynchronous (that is, non-blocking) behavior. - James Hibbard, What Is Node and When Should I Use It?"
```

## Since node operates in a single thread, there are some downsides
* Avoid blocking I/O calls
* Processor-intensive work should go on "worker threads"
* Correct error-handling is imperative to prevent crashing
* [Callback Hell](http://callbackhell.com/)

## Node is excellent for apps that require real-time interactions, APIs that have to handle many I/O requests, or for streaming

## Node.js advantage

* same code on server and client 
* Node speaks JSON
* Can even be used as a local scripting language
