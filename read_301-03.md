# Read: 03 - Flexbox and Templating

# Javascript Templating Language and Engine— Mustache.js with Node and Express
* https://medium.com/@1sherlynn/javascript-templating-language-and-engine-mustache-js-with-node-and-express-f4c2530e73b2

* logic-less
* mustache.js is an implementation of the mustache template system in JavaScript. It is often considered the base for JavaScript templating. And, since mustache supports various languages, we don’t need a separate templating system on the server side.

```javascript
Mustache.render(“Hello, {{name}}”, { name: “Sherlynn” });
// returns: Hello, Sherlynn
```
In the above, we see two braces around {{ name }}. This is Mustache syntax to show that it is a placeholder. When Mustache compiles this, it will look for the ‘name’ property in the object we pass in, and replace {{ name }} with the actual value, e,g, “Sherlynn”.

## Mustache-Express
If you intend you use mustache with Node and Express, you can use mustache-express. Mustache Express lets you use Mustache and Express together easily.

# Complete Guide to FlexBox
* https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/

* "Since flexbox is a whole module and not a single property, it involves a lot of things including its whole set of properties. Some of them are meant to be set on the container (parent element, known as “flex container”) whereas the others are meant to be set on the children (said “flex items”)."
* "If “regular” layout is based on both block and inline flow directions, the flex layout is based on “flex-flow directions”. Please have a look at this figure from the specification, explaining the main idea behind the flex layout."
