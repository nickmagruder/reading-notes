* The process of organizing a DB into columns and tables

### Reasons to normalize: 
* minimize dupes
* minimize issues with modifying data
* make queries simpler

### Modification Anomolies
* Insert Anomaly: can't create a record until we have all info
* Update Anomaly: cant updade without updating many or all rows
* Deletion Anomaly: delting a row (by for example employee ID key) we lose other relational data (the clients for the office location)
* Search and sort issues: multiple tables can be helpful

### Database Normalization
* 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF

```
- "First Normal Form – The information is stored in a relational table with each column containing atomic values. There are no repeating groups of columns.
- Second Normal Form – The table is in first normal form and all the columns depend on the table’s primary key.
- Third Normal Form – the table is in second normal form and all of its columns are not transitively dependent on the primary key" - EssentialSQL
