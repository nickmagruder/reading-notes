# Intro
### HTML: Structure
### CSS: Design/Presentation
### JavaScript: Interactivity and Functionality

# Structure - Chapter 1
* HTML pages are text documents
* HTML uses **tags** - within angle brackets, which tell the browser something about the info within them
* The whole string from of the tags and whats within is an **element**
* Opening tags can carry **attributes** which can tell us more about the content

# Extra Markup - Chapter 8
* span is inline equivalent of div
* Iframes - windows like a google map insert - Pg 189
* Meta Pg 191 - Empty element, does not need a closing tag - **Description** - **Keywords** no longer used by search engines - **robots** whether search engines should include the page: noindex= don't add, nofollow= don't add any linked pages

## **Escape Characters** Pg 193
* Some fonts don't support all escape characters so always double check

# HTML5 Layout - Chapter 17
* Use header, nav, article, and footer over lots of divs
* Articles can live inside other articles
* Asides can also be used inside for out of articles
* Section groups related content together - can also be used inside of a long article to split up its sections
* hgroup -  controversial tag for grouping heading elements
* figure: images, videos, graphs, diagrams, code samples that **are not** integral to the flow of an article
* figcaption: should be added to any figure element to add the description
* div will still be used often, only use article, section, etc for their explicit purposes
* a href with closing ```</a>``` can be used to enclose a block to make the entirety into a link

## Older Browser Code: Pg 442

# Process & Design - Chapter 18
* Understand your target audience - create average users and determine what their needs/wants will be
* Site maps help plan structure
* Wireframes are great for organizing info on a page before coding
* Use **visual hierarchy** to communicate ideally 
* Differentiate between different sections/info with different style/side/color
* Grouping and similarity help simplify info presentation

# JavaScript Chapter 1
# Programming with JavaScript

# Pg 1-24 Intro

### Script - A series of instructions
1. Define the goal
2. Design the script
3. Code each step

### All JavaScript must follow the **Vocabulary** and **Syntax** - Learn it!

### Start with a flowchart before writing any code!

# Chapter 1b - Objects and Properties - Pg 25-42

## Objects
* Things - representations of physical objects
* If there is one hotel and 2 cars, there are 2 **instances** of cars and 1 **instance** of hotel
* Objects have: Properties, events and methods

## Properties (Characteristics)
* Any property has both a **name** and a **value**

## Events
* A script will state which events the programmer wants to respond to, and what part of the script should be run when each of those events occur.

## Methods
* The **how** factor
* Question or instructions that tell something about an object or change values of an object's properties
* The code for a **method** can contain several instructions that together represent one task

## Web Browsers are built using OBJECTS
* Window object: browser represents each window or tab using a **window object** where the **location property** will be the URL
* The current page loaded in a window is the **document object** where a **last modified property** will tell you when last edited
* The **document object** represents a web page in any browser so it will have properties, methods and events and you read properties to find out info about a page etc
* Each element on a page is also an object
* All HTML elements below the document object are called **nodes**

## Any JavaScript is processed by a browser's **interpreter** because it is a **interpreted programming language** and is run line-by-line

# Chapter 1C - Writing script for webpage

##Statements
A script is a series of instructions... a **statement** is an individual instruction, statements end with a semicolon

## HTML, CSS and JavaScript
Progressive Enhancement
* HTML - Content Layer
* CSS - Presentation Layer
* JS - Behavior/interactivity layer


## JavaScript is case sensitive

* Write comments to explain what the code does
* /* multi line */
* // Single Line

## Don't use document.write !!!

# Objects & Methods
This line of code is referred to as **calling** a method of an object

```JavaScript
document.write('Good Afternoon!');
```
**Member.memberoperator('parameters')**

### Place scripts in the HTML where you want the script to be written
