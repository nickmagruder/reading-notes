# HTML5 Storage
## Local Storage, or DOM storage!
* http://diveinto.html5doctor.com/storage.html
* a way for web pages to store named key/value pairs locally within the client's browser
* Never transmitted to web server 
* Available natively in all modern web browsers
* Instead of writing this function yourself, you can use Modernizr to detect support for HTML5 Storage.

## Using HTML5 Storage
* HTML5 Storage is based on named key/value pairs.
* Everything starts as a string (parseint needed for numbers)

## TRACKING CHANGES TO THE HTML5 STORAGE AREA

* The storage event is fired on the window object whenever setItem(), removeItem(), or clear() is called and actually changes something.

## STORAGEEVENT OBJECT
PROPERTY	TYPE	DESCRIPTION
key	string	the named key that was added, removed, or modified
oldValue	any	the previous value (now overwritten), or null if a new item was added
newValue	any	the new value, or null if an item was removed
url*	string	the page which called a method that triggered this change
* Note: the url property was originally called uri. Some browsers shipped with that property before the specification changed. For maximum compatibility, you should check whether the url property exists, and if not, check for the uri property instead.
