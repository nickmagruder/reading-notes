## It's time to internalize the ***Growth Mindset!***

### A growth mindset, in a word, is always keeping a positive attitude towards one's learning and development. Its about keeping an open mind at all times, and always diving head-first into new challenging subjects. 

1. Never let yourself get frustrated! Things will be hard, things will sometimes seem like they can't be fixed. Just keep going!
2. Always remember the big picture; you'll be learning and growing, so feeling uncomfortable or unsure is just right.
3. Don't overthink it!

# The Magic of Markdown
## Coding a website is really hard, right?

We all know that writing the code for a website is essentially impossible. The code is preposterously complicated and there is no way that most people could ever understand the code. I mean, just look at it!

## Turns out, it's not nearly as hard as we all thought!

Fortunately, some very wise and astute people developed a simplified version of HTML tags called **Markdown.** Markdown is a simple code language, that when used in a system that recognizes Markdown, makes for easy web formatting. Instead of having various different opening and closing tags that must bookend each "element" for them to display correctly in a browser, markdown uses greatly simplified versions of these tags.

For example, instead of requiring this element for an image:

```<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl in a jacket">```

One would just enter this:

```![Girl in a jacket](img_girl.jpg)```

Essentially every standard HTML tag has been simplified and shorted in Markdown, making it much easier for anyone to work on a website. You can learn to use Markdown today!
