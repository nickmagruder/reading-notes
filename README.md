## It's time to internalize the ***Growth Mindset!***

### A growth mindset, in a word, is always keeping a positive attitude towards one's learning and development. Its about keeping an open mind at all times, and always diving head-first into new challenging subjects. 

- [ ] Never let yourself get frustrated! Things will be hard, things will sometimes seem like they can't be fixed. Just keep going!
- [ ] Always remember the big picture; you'll be learning and growing, so feeling uncomfortable or unsure is just right.
- [ ] Don't overthink it!
