## It's time to internalize the ***Growth Mindset!***

### A growth mindset, in a word, is always keeping a positive attitude towards one's learning and development. Its about keeping an open mind at all times, and always diving head-first into new challenging subjects. 

1. Never let yourself get frustrated! Things will be hard, things will sometimes seem like they can't be fixed. Just keep going!
2. Always remember the big picture; you'll be learning and growing, so feeling uncomfortable or unsure is just right.
3. Don't overthink it!
