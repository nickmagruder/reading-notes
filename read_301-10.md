# The JavaScript Call Stack - What It Is and Why It's Necessary

* Call stack is last-in- first out (LIFO)
* WHen a function is invoked, it is pushed to the stack and forms a "stack frame" which is a memory location within the stack
* Stack overflow happens when a function calls itself with no exit point

```javascript
function dumbFunction(){
  dumbFunction();
}

dumbFunction();
```
