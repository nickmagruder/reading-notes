# Chapter 15 - Layout - 358-404
* CSS treats every HTML element as its own box
* Block level elemnts on their own line, in-line elements stay in-line
* If an element is contained within another, its container is known as the parent element
* Use divs as containers to group elements

## Positioning Elements
* Normal flow: standard
* Relative: shifts the element "relative" to where it would be normally, without effecting surrounding elements
* Absolute: stuck to the browser window
* Box offset may also be needed
* Pages display in a normal flow unless you use relative, absolute or fixed

### Columns
* Float: left, margin and widths

* Ideal width: 960-1000 px width
* www.960.gs
* Float can move content to left or right, items require a width

## Fixed vs Liquid
* Fixed: does not change with screen or window size, or movement, use px
* Liquid: stretch and contract, tend to use %
* Layouts can be fixed or liquid, both have advantages

* CSS makes your site look PRO
* CSS Frameworks help build out commonly needed tasks
* Grids are where its at!
* Multiple CSS files is okay and sometimes might be needed!
