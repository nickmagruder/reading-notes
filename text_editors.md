## Text Editors
### There are 3 Types

#### Integrated
Windows, iOS and Linux operating systems come with pre-installed text editors, like notepad and text edit. These editors are very basic and don't provide any enhanced functionality.

#### Third Party
These are the most commonly-used text editors for editing code. They vary significantly in cost and functionality, but most offer tools that shortcut the typing of code, and highlight syntax for better analysis. Visual Studio code is a free, Microsoft-developed text editor that has broad functionality and extensions.

#### IDE's
An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a suite of various software in one program. An IDE is typically has a text editor, a file
manager, a compiler, and a debugger.


# The Command Line
## A Cheat Sheet

* https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/commandline.php
* As an example I will typically have 3 terminals open: 1 in which I do my working, another to bring up ancilliary data and a final one for viewing Manual pages (more on these later).
* Line 1 presents us with a prompt ( user@bash ). After that we entered a command ( ls ). Typically a command is always the first thing you type. After that we have what are referred to as command line arguments ( -l /home/ryan ). Important to note, these are separated by spaces (there must be a space between the command and the first command line argument also). The first command line argument ( -l ) is also referred to as an option. Options are typically used to modify the behaviour of the command. Options are usually listed before other arguments and typically start with a dash ( - ).
* The first command we are going to learn is pwd which stands for Print Working Directory. (You'll find that a lot of commands in linux are named as an abbreviation of a word or words describing them. This makes it easier to remember them.) The command does just that. It tells you what your current or present working directory is.
* It's one thing to know where we are. Next we'll want to know what is there. The command for this task is ls. It's short for list. Let's give it a go.
