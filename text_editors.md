## Text Editors
### There are 3 Types

#### Integrated
Windows, iOS and Linux operating systems come with pre-installed text editors, like notepad and text edit. These editors are very basic and don't provide any enhanced functionality.

#### Third Party
These are the most commonly-used text editors for editing code. They vary significantly in cost and functionality, but most offer tools that shortcut the typing of code, and highlight syntax for better analysis. Visual Studio code is a free, Microsoft-developed text editor that has broad functionality and extensions.
