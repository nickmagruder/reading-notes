# Code 401 Notes

# Reading 11 - Event Driven Applications

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Why is access control important?
    - In order to easily give different levels of access to different types of users, and not have to manually assign specific privileges to each user
2. Describe an application that would need access control.
    - A CRM database, would need complete access for Admins, read/write access for data-entry users and read-only access for finance users
3. What is a role used for?
    - To assign a given set of privileges taht can be reused 
4. Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?
    - The role can be easily assigned to each user instead of assigning the access levels to each user manually & individually


## Terms
- Authorization: giving a user permission to access specific functions or resources
- Role Based Access Control: assigned access to users based on their role in the organization
- Capabilities: the specific functions that can be assigned to given roles

# Reading 12 - Socket.io


## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. What is the benefit of transforming data into packets?
    - Data is sent in streams, can be more easily translated between different OS, harder to intercept
2. UDP is often refereed to as a connectionless protocol. Why is this?
    - No receits or handshakes, just streams of data
3. Can a socket server application have multiple socket connections?
    -Yes
4. Can a socket connection application be connected to multiple socket servers?
    -Not ideally
5. Can an application be both a socket server and a socket connection?
    -Yes if on different ports

## Terms

- Observer Pattern: used when there is a "one-to-many" relationship between objects. If one o bject is modified, all dependants are notified
- Listener: the function that "listens" for an event to occur using EventEMitter
- Event Handler; the callback function that then acts after the event occurs
- Event Driven Programming: Programming based on the event loop, responding to events with functions as they occur
- Event Loop: the cylce of event and event handler
- Event Queue: placing events into a queue data structure in order to have them process in FIFO order
- Call Stack: the stack-ordered list of functions 
- Emit/Raise/Trigger: 
- Subscribe: How a client selects specific events or event types to be "nofified" or included in
- database: where data is persisted

# Reading 13 - Message Queues

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. What does it mean that web sockets are bidirectional? Why is this useful?
    - Data can flow both directions simultaneously (like a phone call). Its faster, messages can be sent "real-time" without having to cycle the response-request cycle. Its stable, and simple
2. Does socket.io use HTTP? Why?
     - No, to avoid the request/response cycle. It does "initiate" the connection using HTTP though
3. What happens when a client emits an event?
    - A signal and "payload" are sent out and event listeners can react to them
4. What happens when a server emits an event?
    - Similar to clients, and can be listened by clients
5. What happens if a client “misses” an event?
    - the event disappears
6. How can we mitigate this?
    - A queue can be created on the server with a client-side function that will retrieve messages from the queue instead of just listening directly


## Terms

- Socket: An endpoint for sending or receiving data accross a network or the internet
- Web Socket: a communication protocol providing full-duplex communications over a TCP connection
- Socket.io: "Socket.IO is a library that enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication between the browser and the server. It consists of: a Node.js server: Source, a Javascript client library for the browser (which can be also run from Node.js). [From Sockiet.io docs](https://socket.io/docs/v3/index.html)
- Client: applications that conect to a given "hub" or "server" 
- Server: A hub through which all messages/events pass
- OSI Model:Open System Integration Model for standardized network communication between different operating systems
- TCP Model: Transmission Control Protocol, uses handshaked to create connections
- UDP: User Datagram Protocol, a connectionless protocol designed to stream data
- Packets: how data is transferred over TCP connects, broken into small 'packets'

# Reading 14 - Message Queues

## Review, Research, and Discussion
1. What’s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?
    - Amazon SQS FIFO queues are nearly identical to normal queues, but support "exactly-once" processing and prevent unintentional duplicates
2. How can the server be assured a message was properly received?
    - By added "received" message functionality using queues such that messages are only deleted from the queue once receipt is confirmed
3. What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?
    -   Observer pattern
4. How do you test an event driven system?
    -   Implement effective logging, use a tracing collector, unit tests require a lot more work; ideally an automation process can be built. An entire messages infrascture has to be built before proper testing can be implemented.

## Terms
- FIFO Queue: Amazon SQS FIFO queues are nearly identical to normal queues, but support "exactly-once" processing and prevent unintentional duplicates
- Pub/Sub: Publisher/Subscriber messaging

# Reading 15 - Trees

## Terms
- Node - component containing values and refereences to other nodes
- Root - first node of a tree
- K - the maximum number of children a node may have, K = 2 means only two "branches" off of each node
- Left - reference to the "left" child node 
- Right - ref to the "right" child
- Edge - the "link" between a parent and child
- Leaf - node with no children, the end
- Height - The height of a tree

## Traversal
### Traversal Types
- Depth First - going through "height" first
    - Three methods of depth first:
        - Pre-order: root - left - right
            - Once we reach the leaf, leaf pops-off the stack and previous node becomes the root
        - In-order: left - root - right
        - Post-order: left - right - root
    - Recursion is most common way to traverse a tree

        - Relies on the call stack to navigate back up once reaching a leaf
- Breadth First
    - Iterates through tree by going through each "level" of the the tree node-by-node
    - Typically uses a queue(instead of call stack w/ recursion)

### Binary Tree (From Udemy)
- Excel at searching

### Binary Search Tree (From Udemy)
- Special case binary tree, are kept in a specific order 
- Sortable, comparable

### Binary tree VS K-ary tree
- Nodes can have more 2 children
- k is maximum children per node
- Breadth traversal also uses queue, where each node's children get enqueeued with each "root" node
    - Then each of those children becomes a "root" and adds its children to the queue (in order, such that the next row's children will all line up just as the first row did)
### Adding Nodes
- No structural rules wher a node "must" go - nodes can go anywherre
    - One strategy is just to fill all child nodes from top down, using breadth traversal to fill all unfilled nodes
### Big O
- Insterting a node time complex. is O(n)), also searching for a specific node. Worse case involves traversing the entire tree.
- Space complexity for insertion is O(w) where w is the tree width

        - (See Repo Notes)

    - TOAST: mobile application word for notifications
    - Curly brackets don't work inside a console log
- Messenger Demo Code @ 10:45
- Full Demo - 11:11
    - Wiring the Server - 11:11 - 11:38
    - Tests - starts~11:42~11:45
- "We'll take a look at the lab, it should follow along hopefully"

<br/><br/><br/><br/>

# Tuesday 3/2

## Code Challenge 11 Review 
- 9:00

## Lab 11 Review - 9:26
- Hub, vendor, driver
    - Events.js - file that makes the same eventPool available to other files, won't be used for the rest of the labs

## TCP - 10:20
- Replacing node events module with TCP connection
    - Node does have a built-in TCP module, but very esoteric, hard to program with it
- TCP: important. Transmission Control Protocol
    - After TCP handshake, can send and receive simultaneously - "Full Duplex"
    - In JS we interact using Web Sockets
        - An upgraded HTTP connection, also fully duplex
        - Cumbersome, so we use the Socket.io library
- Socket.io
    - Features
        - The event driver featues of Node Events
        - Full complex communicastion of TCP / WebSockets
        - UML doesn't change significantly from Socketless Lab 11
        - Packet is a "buffer" or stream of bytes
        - JavaScript has built-in ways to deal with buffer streams
            - No buffers to deal with using Socket.io
            - Socket.io converts the buffer stream from JSON to buffer bytyes back to JSON
        - Allows us to name our events, which isn't possible or easy with regular TCP 
    - Changes from Lab 11
        - Hub will run on a server
        - Vender and Driver will both make donnections via TCP/Websocket
        - TCP connection will be faux, but Vender/Driver/Hub will run in their own terminals
- Socket.io Demo - 10:41
    - 3 folders - one for server, one for each client, each one needs its own package.json (effectively separate nodes)
    - npm install socket-io
    - npm install socket.io-client
    - The server and each client has a URL (localhost)

- Lab 11:48
    - No web clients
    - Don't worrk about "each store wil have its on "room" within the "caps' namespace
    - Everything through caps
    - "don't worry about deploying this today either" 11:58
