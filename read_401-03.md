# Reading 15 - Trees

## Terms
- Node - component containing values and refereences to other nodes
- Root - first node of a tree
- K - the maximum number of children a node may have, K = 2 means only two "branches" off of each node
- Left - reference to the "left" child node 
- Right - ref to the "right" child
- Edge - the "link" between a parent and child
- Leaf - node with no children, the end
- Height - The height of a tree

## Traversal
### Traversal Types
- Depth First - going through "height" first
    - Three methods of depth first:
        - Pre-order: root - left - right
            - Once we reach the leaf, leaf pops-off the stack and previous node becomes the root
        - In-order: left - root - right
        - Post-order: left - right - root
    - Recursion is most common way to traverse a tree
        - Relies on the call stack to navigate back up once reaching a leaf
- Breadth First
    - Iterates through tree by going through each "level" of the the tree node-by-node
    - Typically uses a queue(instead of call stack w/ recursion)
### Binary tree VS K-ary tree
- Nodes can have more 2 children
- k is maximum children per node
- Breadth traversal also uses queue, where each node's children get enqueeued with each "root" node
    - Then each of those children becomes a "root" and adds its children to the queue (in order, such that the next row's children will all line up just as the first row did)
### Adding Nodes
- No structural rules wher a node "must" go - nodes can go anywherre
    - One strategy is just to fill all child nodes from top down, using breadth traversal to fill all unfilled nodes
### Big O
- Insterting a node time complex. is O(n)), also searching for a specific node. Worse case involves traversing the entire tree.
- Space complexity for insertion is O(w) where w is the tree width





# Lecture Notes

# Monday - 3/1

## Event Driven
- Pub / Dub Design pattern
    - Something gets published
    - Something is waiting for published events to response
        - (See Repo Notes)

    - TOAST: mobile application word for notifications
    - Curly brackets don't work inside a console log
- Messenger Demo Code @ 10:45
- Full Demo - 11:11
    - Wiring the Server - 11:11 - 11:38
    - Tests - starts~11:42~11:45
- "We'll take a look at the lab, it should follow along hopefully"

# Tuesday 3/2

## Code Challenge 11 Review 
- 9:00

## Lab 11 Review - 9:26
- Hub, vendor, driver
    - Events.js - file that makes the same eventPool available to other files, won't be used for the rest of the labs

## TCP - 10:20
- Replacing node events module with TCP connection
    - Node does have a built-in TCP module, but very esoteric, hard to program with it
- TCP: important. Transmission Control Protocol
    - After TCP handshake, can send and receive simultaneously - "Full Duplex"
    - In JS we interact using Web Sockets
        - An upgraded HTTP connection, also fully duplex
        - Cumbersome, so we use the Socket.io library
- Socket.io
    - Features
        - The event driver featues of Node Events
        - Full complex communicastion of TCP / WebSockets
        - UML doesn't change significantly from Socketless Lab 11
        - Packet is a "buffer" or stream of bytes
        - JavaScript has built-in ways to deal with buffer streams
            - No buffers to deal with using Socket.io
            - Socket.io converts the buffer stream from JSON to buffer bytyes back to JSON
        - Allows us to name our events, which isn't possible or easy with regular TCP 
    - Changes from Lab 11
        - Hub will run on a server
        - Vender and Driver will both make donnections via TCP/Websocket
        - TCP connection will be faux, but Vender/Driver/Hub will run in their own terminals
- Socket.io Demo - 10:41
    - 3 folders - one for server, one for each client, each one needs its own package.json (effectively separate nodes)
    - npm install socket-io
    - npm install socket.io-client
    - The server and each client has a URL (localhost)

- Lab 11:48
    - No web clients
    - Don't worrk about "each store wil have its on "room" within the "caps' namespace
    - Everything through caps
    - "don't worry about deploying this today either" 11:58


# Wednesday 3/3

## process.argv (and finish of Lab 12 demo) - 10:50

## Lab Demo 11:09
- Only one client (just server & client)
-           

## Thursday 3/4

### - AWS SQS - 9:40
- Simple Queue Service
- AWS Auth = IAM
- Creating the queue on AWS - 9:51
    - 2 dependencies needed
    - Code to host on AWS @ ~9:55

    - Terminal interface
        - Inquirer - npm library

# Friday 3/5

## 10:24 - Coffee Meeting questions - REWATCH THIS
