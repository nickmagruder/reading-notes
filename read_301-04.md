## Once you learn it, Grid will be your savior
If you're just starting out, CSS layout can send you down the rabit hole. I know it stil does for me. Especially when beginning to get margins, percentages and floats correct, your page just seems to dance around inexplcibly. it is definitely important to learn and memorize as many CSS properties as you can, but the most important thing to know, is that it gets easier!

Grid isn't going to solve every single layout you'll want to accomplish, but in my opinion, it is the easiest and most versatile CSS layout tool. It makes it possible to align an entire page along a series of columns and rows, and if needed, create subsets of columns and rows (additional grids) within those spaces. The sky is the limit!

To get started, I would recommend using the two resources linked above, which can provide you with a great foundation for getting started in creating beautiful and easy CSS layouts.
