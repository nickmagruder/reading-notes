# Computer Architecture and Logic

## What's a computer? Why a bunch of 0s and 1s of course!
* Not a manual tool
* Can a tool help us think?
* Input, Storage, Processing, Output

## How do they work?
* Electrical wires and circuits, signal is either on or off, each wire is 1bit
* More wires, more bits, ie 32bit, vs 64bit
* CPU is a tiny collection of bits(wires) and circuits and architecture that knows where to send electrical signals
* Circuits interpret/flip/change/combine bits
* When combined together, greater complexity of calculations can be accomplished

## Hardware and Software
* Core of processing is in the CPU, and all code is converted to binary by the CPU
* Operating System is the master program that manages all other software and how they interact with the CPU, memory, etc
