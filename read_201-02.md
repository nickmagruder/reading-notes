# Chapter 2 - Text - Pgs. 40-61
* Headings: h1-h6
* Paragraph: p
* Bold: b, italic: i
* Superscript: sup, subscript: sub
* White space is collapsed

## Empty Elements:
* Line break: br
* ```<hr />```

* ```<strong>``` makes text bold
* ```<em>``` makes italic
* ```<blockquote>``` creates indented quoteblock
* ```<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof</abbr> Stephen Hawking is a cosmologist.</p>``` Abbreviations & Acronmyns
* ```<cite>``` citations
* ```<dfn>``` definitions
* ```<address>``` very specific: to contain the address of the page author
* ```<ins>``` and ```<del>``` for content that his been deleted (strikethrough) or inserted
* ```<s>``` deprecated strikethrough


# Chapter 10 - Introducing CSS - Pg 227
## CSS makes pages pretty!

* An invisible box around every element!

### Associate with a single element or multiple

```CSS 
p{
    font-family: arial;
}
```

```CSS 
h1, h2, h3{
    font-family: arial;
}
```

* CSS can be internal, within the HTML doc, but is ideally contained in a seperate file called style.css and is linked in the HTML

### CSS Selectors are on Pg 238

### CSS rules cascade: the last rule, most specific, !important;

# JS Chapter 2 - Pg. 54 - Basic JavaScript Instructions

## Statements
* Each individual instruction or step is a **statement**, and should end with a **;**
* Curly braces indicate the start and end of a code block
* JS is case sensitive
* Statements are instructions, each starts on a new line and end with a semicolon, telling the browser when the step is over
* Some statements are surrounded in curly braces, these are known as **code blocks**. The closing curly brace is **not** followed by a semicolon

### Comments
* Just like in HTML or CSS, insert comments to explain what a statement or code block is accomplishing

```JavaScript
/* Multi
line
comment */ 
```

```JavaScript
//inline comment 
```

## Variables
* Scripts must temporarily store bits of info they need to do their jobs, this is stored in **variables**
* Variables are comparable to short-term memory
* Well-named because the data stored in a variable can change each time a script runs

### How to declare Variables
* Variables must be "declared", or named

```JavaScript
var quantity; 
```

VariableKeyword  VariableName;

* if the variable name is more than one word, write in camelCase

### Assigning value to variables
* Once a variable is created(named) you can **assign a value** to the variable

```JavaScript 
quantity = 3; 
```

VariableName AssignmentOperator VariableValue;

* The = is an assignment operator, it says that you are going to assign a value to the variable, it is also used to **update** the value
* Until a value has been assigned, the value is **undefined**.

## Data Types - Pg 62
* JS distinguishes between numbers, strings and booleans(true/false)

* Numeric data type: Numbers - 999999.99
* String Data type: 'This is a string' - can contain HTML markup
* Boolean: True or False, light a light switch

### Using a Variable to Store a Number
* Once a value is applied to a variable, use the variable name to represent that value

### Using a Variable to Store a String
* Within quotes, must be written on one line 

```JavaScript
var userName;
    userName = 'Nick';
```

### Using quotes inside a string
* If you need to use a " or ' inside a string, use the opposite " or ' to enclose that string
* You can also "escape" the quote mark with a backslash, ie \"

### Using a variable to store a Boolean

```JavaScript
var inStock;
    inStock = 'False';
```

### Shorthand for creating variables
```JavaScript
var price = 5;
var quantity = 14;
var total = price * quantity
```

OR

```JavaScript
var price, quantity, total;
price = 5;
quantity = 14;
total = price * quantity;
```

OR
```JavaScript
var price = 5, quantity = 14;
var total = price * quantity;
```

## Changing the Value of a Variable
* Just right the variable and = theNewValue;
* inStock = false;

## Rules for Naming Variables
1. Name must begin with a letter, $, or _. It must NOT start with a number
2. Name can contain letters, numers, $ or _. Do NOT use a - or . in a variable name.
3. Do NOT use keywords or reserved words, for example var.
4. names are case sensitive
5. Use a name that describes the type of info the variable contains, ie: firstName or quantity
6. Use camelCase

## Arrays - Pg 70
### Special: doesn't store just one value, but a list of values
* Use whenever working with a list or set of values that are all related
* Helpful when you dont know how many values a list will contain
* Very helpful for complex data

### Array Literal (preferred method):
```javascript
var colors;
colors = ['white', 'black', 'custom'];

var el = document.getElementById('colors');
el.textContent = colors[0];
```

### Or in an Array Constructor:
```javascript
var colors = new Array;('white',
                        'black',
                        'custom');

var el = document.getElementById('colors');
el.textContent = colors[0];
```

## Values in arrays are accessed as if in a numbered list that starts with 0
* Each item automatically given a number called its **index**
* use the index to retrieve a specific list item:

```javascript
var itemThree;
itemThree = colors[2];
```
This pulls the third item from a previous array called "colors"

## Arrays also have a value called length; the number of items

```javascript
var numColors;
numColors = colors.length;
```

## Accessing & Changing Array Values
```javascript
// Create the array and assign it values
var colors = ['white', 'black', 'custom'];

// Update the third item in the array
colors[2] = 'beige';

// Get the element with an id of colors
var el = document.getElementById('colors');
// Replace element with third item from the array
el.textContent = colors[2];
```

# Expressions + Operators Pgs 74-84

## Expressions Pg 74
* An expresson results in a single value.

* Type 1: Just assigning a value to a variable.
```JavaScript
var color = 'beige';
```

* Type 2: Expressions that use two or more values to return a single value
* You can peform operations on any number of individual values to get a single value
```Javascript
var area = 3 * 2;
```
* The value of area is now 6

## Operators Pg 75
Expressions rely on operators, they allow code to create a single value from multiple values

* **Assignment** operators: assign a value to a variable
* **Arithmetic** operators: perform basic math
* **String** operators: combine two strings: greeting = 'Hi ' + 'Molly';

Covered in Chapter 4
* **Comparison** operators: compare two values and return True or false: buy = 3 > 5; This value is False
* **Logical** operators: combine expressions and return True or False: buy = (5 > 3) && (2 < 4); This value is True

## Arithmetic Operators PG 76
JS contains the following math operators that can be used with numnbers

* Addition | + | Adds one value to another | 10 + 5 | 15 |
* Subtraction | - | Subtracts one value from another | | |
* Divison | / | Divides two values | | |
* Multiply | * | Multiplies | | |
* Increment | ++ | Adds **one** to the current value | i = 10; i++; | 11 |
* Decrement | -- | Subtracts **one** from the current value | i = 10; i--; | 9 |
* Modulus | % | Divides two values and returns the remainder | 10 % 3 | 1 |

Arithmetic order of operations is the same as in algebra

## String Operator Pg 78
There is just one: +
* Joining two strings is called **concatenation**
```javascript
var firstName = 'Nick';
var lastName = 'Magruder';
var fullName = firstName + lastName;
```

If you try to add a number to a string, it just adds it to the string, ie 12Ivy Road.
IF you try to use arithmetic operators on a string, you get **NaN** - not a number

### Using String Operators
```javascript
var greeting = 'Howdy ';
var name = 'Molly';

var welcomeMessage = greeting + name + '!';
```

# Chapter 4 - Decisions & Loops 145-149
* Evaluations: analyzing values to see if they are correct
* Decisions: Use results of eveluations, decide which path to go down
* Loops: Repeating steps
* To determine which path, set a **decision**, ie: value equals value, or is greater than, if true, one path, false, then another
* **comparison operators** allow you to compare values and test whether a condition is met; ie: > , < , and ==.

### There are two components to a decision:
1. An expression is evaluated and returns a value
2. A conditional statement saus what to do in a given situation



# Operators and Loops 150-151

## Comparison Operators: Evaluating Conditions
You can evaluate a stuation by comparing one value in the script to what you expect it might be. The result will be a Boolean: true or false.

### ==
**IS EQUAL TO**
* This operator compares two values  to see if they are the same
* 'Hello' == 'Goodbye' returns False
* 'Hello' == 'Hello' returns True

It is usually preferable to use the strict method:
### ===
**STRICT EQUAL TO**
* Compares two values to cehck that tboth the data type and value are the same.
* '3' === 3 returns false

### !=
**IS NOT EQUAL TO**
* Compares two values to see if they are *not* the same
* 'hello' != 'Goodbye' returns true

It is usually preferable to use the strict method:
### !==
**STRICT NOT EQUAL TO**
* Compares two values to check that both the data type AND value are not the same
* '3' !== 3 returns TRUE
* '3' !== '3' returns FALSE because they ARE the same data type and value

### >
**GREATER THAN**

### <
**LESS THAN**

### >=
**GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO**

### <=
**LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO**

## Comparison Operators 152-155
* In any condition; typically one **operator** and two **operands**

```javascript
(score >= pass)
```
Operand ComparisonOperator Operand

## Using Comparison Operators 153

```javascript
var pass = 50;   // Pass mark
var score = 90;  // Score

// Check if the user has passed
var hasPassed = score >= pass;

// Write the message into the page
var el = document.getElementById('answer');
el.innerHTML = 'Level passed: ' + hasPassed;
```

## Using Expressions with Comparison Operators
Operand does not have to be single valuable or variable; it can be an expression

```javascript
((score1 + score2) > (highScore1 + highScore2))
```
(Operand) ComparisonOperator (Operand)

## Comparing Two Expressions
```javascript
var score1 = 90;     // Round 1 score
var score2 = 95;     // Round 2 score
var highScore1 = 75; // Round 1 high score
var highScore2 = 95; // Round 2 high score

// Check if scores are higher than current high scores
var comparison = (score1 + score2) > (highScore1 + highScore2);

// Write the message into the page
var el = document.getElementById('answer');
el.innerHTML = 'New high score: ' + comparison;
```

## Logical Operators Pg 156
Comparison operators return single TRUE/FALSE values while Logical Operators allow you to compare the reults more than one comparison operator

Logical operator below is &&

```javascript
((5 < 2) && (2 >= 3))
```

## &&
**LOGICAL AND**
* Tests more than one condition
* ((2 < 5) && (3 >= 2))
* Returns TRUE
* If both expressions evaluate to true, then the expression returns true. If just one of these returns false, then the expression will return false.

## ||
**LOGICAL OR**
* Tests at least one condition
* ((2 < 5) || (2 < 1))
* Returns TRUE
* If EITHER expression returns returns, only returns false if both are false.

## !
**LOGICAL NOT**
* Takes a single boolean and INVERTS it
* !(2 < 1)
* Returns TRUE
* Reverses the state of an expression.

## Short Circuit Evaluation
If the logic can be figured out in the first expression, there's no need to evaluate the second

# 158-162
## Logical AND

```javascript
var score1 = 8;   // Round 1 score
var score2 = 8;   // Round 2 score
var pass1 = 6;    // Round 1 pass mark
var pass2 = 6;    // Round 2 pass mark

// Check whether user passed both rounds, store result in variable
var passBoth = (score1 >= pass1) && (score2 >= pass2);

// Create message
var msg = 'Both rounds passed: ' + passBoth;

// Write the message into the page
var el = document.getElementById('answer');
el.innerHTML = msg;
```

## Logical OR & Logical NOT

```javascript
var score1 = 8;   // Round 1 score
var score2 = 8;   // Round 2 score
var pass1 = 6;    // Round 1 pass mark
var pass2 = 6;    // Round 2 pass mark

// Check whether user passed one of the two rounds, store result in variable
var minPass = (score1 >= pass1) || (score2 >= pass2);

// Create message
var msg = 'Resit required: ' + !minPass;

// Write the message into the page
var el = document.getElementById('answer');
el.innerHTML = msg;
```

## IF Statements

```javascript
if (score >= 50) {
    congratulate();
}
```
If true, congratulate executes
