# The Magic of Markdown
## Coding a website is really hard, right?

We all know that writing the code for a website is essentially impossible. The code is preposterously complicated and there is no way that most people could ever understand the code. I mean, just look at it!

## Turns out, it's not nearly as hard as we all thought!

Fortunately, some very wise and astute people developed a simplified version of HTML tags called **Markdown.** Markdown is a simple code language, that when used in a system that recognizes Markdown, makes for easy web formatting. Instead of having various different opening and closing tags that must bookend each "element" for them to display correctly in a browser, markdown uses greatly simplified versions of these tags.

For example, instead of requiring this element for an image:

```<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl in a jacket">```

One would just enter this:

```![Girl in a jacket](img_girl.jpg)```

Essentially every standard HTML tag has been simplified and shorted in Markdown, making it much easier for anyone to work on a website. You can learn to use Markdown today!
