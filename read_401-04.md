# Reading 16 - AWS: Cloud Servers

## Review, Research, and Discussion
1. What’s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?
    - Amazon SQS FIFO queues are nearly identical to normal queues, but support "exactly-once" processing and prevent unintentional duplicates
2. How can the server be assured a message was properly received?
    - By added "received" message functionality using queues such that messages are only deleted from the queue once receipt is confirmed
3. What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?
    -   Observer pattern
4. How do you test an event driven system?
    -   Implement effective logging, use a tracing collector, unit tests require a lot more work; ideally an automation process can be built. An entire messages infrascture has to be built before proper testing can be implemented.

## Terms
- Server: A hub through which all messages/events pass
- Pub/Sub: Publisher/Subscriber messaging
- WRRC - Web Response/Request cycle

## Terms
- Server Instances: a virtual machine on an AWS server running one of many OS types
- Containers: "Containers provide a standard way to package your application's code, configurations, and dependencies into a single object. Containers share an operating system installed on the server and run as resource-isolated processes, ensuring quick, reliable, and consistent deployments, regardless of environment."[https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/deep-dive-containers/](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/deep-dive-containers/)
- Cloud Services: Cloud-based hosting, storage and other tools that help with running websites and web applications
- Cloud Architecture: "Cloud computing architecture refers to the components and subcomponents required for cloud computing. These components typically consist of a front end platform (fat client, thin client, mobile ),back end platforms (servers, storage), a cloud based delivery, and a network (Internet, Intranet, Intercloud). Combined, these components make up cloud computing architecture." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing_architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing_architecture)
- AWS: Amazon Web Services
- EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku: EC2 and Beanstalk provide similar hosting functionality to what Heroku provides

## Terms
- Serverless Functions: running individual functions and components "on-demand" without a constantly-running server 
- Cloud Storage: data stored on a remote server like AWS or Azure
- CDN: Content Delivery Network - a distributed network of servers that are geographically closer to users for faster response times

# Lecture Notes

# Monday 3/8

## Reading/Lab/Challenge Notes:
[What is a virtual machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIVXjl4SwVo)
- Virtual Machine Manager or hypervisor
    - ALlows running different OS with an OS
[Virtualization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0DfHUWMjsU)
- Virtualization and the cloud
    - Hypervisor allowed creating virtual machinesjjj
[Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/?ec2-whats-new.sort-by=item.additionalFields.postDateTime&ec2-whats-new.sort-order=desc)
- Elastic Compute Cloud
- "Amazon EC2 is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud."
[EC2 for Humans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZMkgOMYYIg)
### Elastic Beanstalk
- Different Remote Computer Options:
    - M=Multipurpose
    - C=Compute Optomized
    - T="Burst" for spikey applications
- Auto-assign Public IP: Enable to make web-accessible
- IAM role: what capabalities it has
- EBS: Elastic Block Storage
- Security Group
    - Type: SSH: Protocol: TCP: Port Range: 22 Source: My IP
    - IP Range might be needed using "cider"
    - Other Security Group Notes:
        - Inbound: managing what can access your instance, should be as strict as possible
- Review Launch instance
    - Key Pair: required for logging in, must be saved securely and NEVER LOSE I
### Connecting to the new Instance
- Use terminal
- ssh -i <path-to-paypair.pem> <username@publicdns>
- Cannot connect if key-pair .peb file is not protected - file must protected
- Run command:
    - chmod 400 <path-to-paypair.pem>


## Lecture Notes
- [Spread](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax)
- [Destructuering Assignment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment)

### Spread
- Make sure spread is surrounded by the "shape" that you want, ie: brackets around an array within an object

        - Path: /people
    - Create a method - Define an HTTP method for accessing resource
    - Define GET on /people
        - /people GET Setup
            - Integration type: Lambda Function
                - Must have a function set-up in the region selected (since doing endpoint Regional)
    - Create the  Lambda Function 
    - 10:35
        - node.js 14.x runtime
        - name "read-people"
    - Return to defining GET on /people
        - Lambda function: read-people
        - Select "use lambda proxy integration" YES
        - Add permission to Lambda Function - OK
        - We now have a testable route - 3-10 1.png
            - TEST, displays the AWS response object log
            - Don't add trigger yet
    - Deploying
    - 10:44
        - Actions
            - Deploymenty stage new stage
            - name : test

        - Creates a URL (that won't do anything at this point, no actions)
    - Finding an error after deploying
        - Go to CloudWatch - Log Groups

- DynamoDB
    - NoSQL AWS DB
    - Create DynamnoDB Table
    - 10:48
        - name:
        - primary key: id, string !!!!!
            - "Scaler values"
            - Make sure you know what data type your primary key is going to be
            - Whatever we choose we will have to make happen in the lambda function

        - Create.
        - When created, values can be added from GUI
            - Overview gives basic overview
        - Creating an item: 
        - 10:52
            - id: 001
            - + insert: string: name: Jacob
            - If saving without unique ID it will error
        - We do want a schema

```
const dynamoose = require('dynamoose');

const peopleSchema = new dynamoose.Schema({

    'id': String,
    'name': String,
    'phone': String,

}):

moduke.exports = dynamoose.model('people', peopleSchema);
```

- Return to index.js
- Add:

```
const peopleModel = requre('./people.schema.js'):
```


        ```javascript
        exports.handler = async (event)=> {

            let data;

            try {
                data = await peopleModel.scan().exec();

            } catch (e) {

                **SEE DEMO FOR CODE**
            }


            let response = {
                statusCode: 200,
                body: JSON.stringify(data),
            }
            return response;
        }
        ```
