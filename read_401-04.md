# Code 401 Notes

# Reading 16 - AWS: Cloud Servers

## Review, Research, and Discussion
1. Whatâ€™s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?
    - Amazon SQS FIFO queues are nearly identical to normal queues, but support "exactly-once" processing and prevent unintentional duplicates
2. How can the server be assured a message was properly received?
    - By added "received" message functionality using queues such that messages are only deleted from the queue once receipt is confirmed
3. What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?
    -   Observer pattern
4. How do you test an event driven system?
    -   Implement effective logging, use a tracing collector, unit tests require a lot more work; ideally an automation process can be built. An entire messages infrascture has to be built before proper testing can be implemented.
